Registry
========


Introduction
------------

Registry is a platform that catches spatial records using pycsw, classifies them
in user-defined catalogs using Elasticsearch and store its image with Mapproxy.
Registry allows the user to separate spatial data in catalogs but search on all
of them at the same time. Once a layer is added into registry, the user is able
to retreive metadata, mapproxy config or thumbnail by hitting different
endpoints.

Records could be defined as a list of descriptive information. For registry, we
can describe records as a collection of geospatial metadata. Each record has
metadata classified and organized within specific keys, i.e. bounding box,
source, title, among others. For each server, we can retreive these records
using different methods. For registry, the user must have its records stored in
xml files. Each file must specify the interfaces and bindings defined by the
OGC standards.

Requirements
------------

- Elasticsearch: Registry has been tested with versions 1.7.5 and 5.0


Usage
-----

Registry is written in python and uses Django framework. First, is necessary
to configure the pycsw database.

	| python registry.py pycsw -c setup_db

Then, start the server

	| python registry.py runserver

Then, you need to start elasticsearch search engine. You can verify if
elasticsearch is running, executing the following command:

	| elasticsearch -v

By default, the server will listen in port 8000. Depending on the request
method, Registry will process each received request differently. The user is
free to use its own software, like Paw, postman or curl (if you are a Terminal
ninja) to generate requests.

Now, suppose we have 200 records separated in two files of 100, named xml_1.xml
and xml_2.xml. We want to store each file in two separated catalogs. First is
necessary to create the catalogs for elasticsearch generating the following
request. We will use catalog_1 and catalog_2 catalog names.

	| curl -XPUT http://localhost:8000/catalog/catalog_1/csw

to create catalog_1 and

	| curl -XPUT http://localhost:8000/catalog/catalog_2/csw

to create the second catalog. Note that to create catalogs we use the PUT
request method. For each request, we will receive a status code of 200 and
the 'Catalog_X has been created succesfully' 

Second, we need to store the records. For each file, we execute the following
requests.

	| curl -XPOST http://localhost:8000/catalog/catalog_1/csw -d @xml_1.xml

	| curl -XPOST http://localhost:8000/catalog/catalog_2/csw -d @xml_2.xml

The server will use pycsw to parse the records within the xml file defined in
the payload. Each record will be stored into the pycsw database and indexed
into elasticsearch. It is important to note that pycsw created an alphanumerical
identifier for each record.

Registry comes with an api client to retreive metadata from elasticsearch. Is
possible to query searches applying different constraints. For instance, we
can search by time, or search by date. The output format will be json. If you
want to query for catalog_1 you need to execute the following request.

	| curl -XGET http://localhost:8000/catalog/catalog_1/api

For all catalogs

	| curl -XGET http://localhost:8000/api

Mapproxy is a proxy server which stores in a cache geospatial data from remote
web services. Registry takes advantage of this service, enabling the user to
grab additional information, like images. For instance, when hitting the
following endpoint

	| curl -XGET http://localhost:8000/layer/<layer_uuid>.yml

where <layer_uuid> corresponds to the record identifier generated by pycsw,
Registry produces a configuration file in yaml format, that is required by
Mapproxy. Now when executing the following request

	| curl -XGET http://localhost:8000/layer/<layer_uuid>

Registry generates the configuration file for the given record and creates a
Mapproxy server instance within Registry, where is possible to use Mapproxy
features as a standalone server. Another feature of Registry is to generate a
record thumbnail, executing the following request.

	| curl -XGET http://localhost:8000/layer/<layer_uuid>.png

Registry, will create the mapproxy configuration file, run a mapproxy instance,
and finally execute an image query to the remote web server, that is specified
within the record metadata to get the image thumbnail, that will be returned by
Registry.
